Student activity 1:
It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years,
However, this simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach 
adulthood in approximately 2 years. 
As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the 
first 2 human years ad 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional 
human year a 4 dog year.
Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to 
dog years described. Ensure your program works correctly.
Should a negative value be input, the program should advise user of the
issue.

associated with that year.
The program should work with a year greater than zero.
